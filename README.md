**Project Status: Ongoing**

Novel Bitcoin Payment Service aims to be your very own payment service, attaining the goal of Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System as envisioned by Satoshi Nakamoto.

In the Bitcoin white paper written by Nakamoto, Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System is described as allowing payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution.

This payment service does not aim to be a financial institution. Rather, this payment service aims to be a means for ordinary folks to send bitcoin, whether as payment or donation, to one another, that is, without an intermediary financial institution.

Specifically, this payment service will allow ordinary folks to:
1. Create Bitcoin Addresses
2. Create Smart Contracts
3. Check Bitcoin address balance and transaction details using an in-built blockchain explorer
4. Receive bitcoin
5. Send bitcoin 
6. Communicate regarding the received or sent bitcoin within the Bitcoin blockchain

Unknown to many, Nakamoto built within the Bitcoin infrastructure a means for senders and receivers to communicate with each other. Nakamoto also built within the Bitcoin infrastructure smart contracts. These in-built communication system and smart contracts within the Bitcoin blockchain will be put into use in this novel Bitcoin Payment System.
