**Project Name:**

Novel Bitcoin Payment Service


**Project Description:**

Unknown to many, Bitcoin has an in-built infrastructure for senders and receivers to communicate with each other. Bitcoin also has an in-built infrastructure for smart contracts. These in-built messaging system and smart contracts within the Bitcoin infrastructure will be put into use in this Novel Bitcoin Payment Service. Specifically, this payment service allows ordinary folks to:
1. Create bitcoin addresses
2. Create smart contracts using Bitcoin's in-built infrastructure (including but not limited to escrow and inheritance smart contracts without third party)
3. Check bitcoin address balance using an in-built blockchain explorer
4. Receive bitcoin
5. Send bitcoin
6. Allow transaction parties (sender and receiver) to communicate with each other using Bitcoin's in-built messaging system

The project will produce an app for Linux and Windows desktops. This app is non-custodial, giving users full control of their funds. Grant funding is necessary as there is no way to repay generous donors as the app is free, does not generate any earnings, and open source. The app is a proof of concept.


**Potential Impact to the Bitcoin Community:**

Novel Bitcoin Payment Service aims to be one's very own payment service, attaining the goal of "Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System" as envisioned by Satoshi Nakamoto. In Nakamoto's Bitcoin white paper, Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System is described as enabling "online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution". This payment service does not aim to be a financial institution. Rather, this payment service aims to be a means for ordinary folks to send bitcoin to one another without an intermediary financial institution.


**Milestones:**

The following are the key milestones for this project:

. Partial activation of the app front-end -> Link: https://github.com/ellenrapps/Novel-Bitcoin-Payment-Service-/blob/main/front_end.py

. Complete activation of the create taproot single signature address, key-pair button -> Link: https://github.com/ellenrapps/Novel-Bitcoin-Payment-Service-/blob/main/master.py

. Complete activation of the check bitcoin address balance button -> Link: https://github.com/ellenrapps/Novel-Bitcoin-Payment-Service-/blob/main/front_end.py


**Potential Milestones:**

. Full implementation of the Bitcoin Protocol in a language that scales up Bitcoin

. Complete activation of the app's in-built blockchain explorer

. Complete activation of the escrow and inheritance smart contracts using Bitcoin's in-built infrastructure

. Complete activation of the app's messaging system using Bitcoin's in-built infrastructure

. Official launching of the Novel Bitcoin Payment Service - Mainnet


**Project Status: Discontinued**

A project of this scale needs funding. Even after months of actively looking for grant funding, as this project earns no money, this project has received zero financial support. This project in its current state will no longer be pursued or discontinued.

Thank you for your interest.
