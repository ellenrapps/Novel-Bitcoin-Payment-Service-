# Novel-Bitcoin-Payment-Service

Bitcoin Payment Service aims to be your very own payment service -- attaining the goal of "Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System" as envisioned by Satoshi Nakamoto.

In Nakamoto's Bitcoin white paper, Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System is described as allowing  "online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution".

This payment service doesn't aim to be a financial institution. Rather, this payment service aims to be a means for ordinary folks to send bitcoin, whether as payment or donation, to one another, that is, without an intermediary financial institution.

Specifically, this payment service will allow ordinary folks to:
1. Create bitcoin addresses
2. Create smart contracts
3. Check bitcoin address balance using an in-built blockhain explorer
4. Receive bitcoin 
5. Send bitcoin 
6. Communicate regarding the received or sent satoshis within the Bitcoin blockchain 

Unknown to many, Nakamoto built within the Bitcoin infrastracture a means for senders and receivers to communicate with each other. Nakamoto also built within the Bitcoin infrastracture smart contracts. These in-built communication system and smart contracts within the Bitcoin blockchain will be put into use in this novel Bitcoin Payment Service.

This Bitcoin Payment Service is a work in progress. Support this endeavor through Github's Sponsor program or via bitcoin donation:
