# Novel Bitcoin Payment Service

**Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)**


**What is the purpose of this project?**

Novel Bitcoin Payment Service aims to be your very own payment service, attaining the goal of "Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System" as envisioned by Satoshi Nakamoto. In Nakamoto's Bitcoin white paper, Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System is described as enabling "online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution".

Unknown to many, Bitcoin has an in-built infrastructure for senders and receivers to communicate with each other. Bitcoin also has an in-built infrastructure for smart contracts. These in-built messaging system and smart contracts within the Bitcoin blockchain will be put into use in this Novel Bitcoin Payment Service.

This payment service doesn't aim to be a financial institution. Rather, this payment service aims to be a means for ordinary folks to send bitcoin to one another without an intermediary financial institution. Specifically, this payment service allows ordinary folks to:
1. Create bitcoin addresses
2. Create smart contracts using Bitcoin's in-built infrastructure (including but not limited to an escrow system without third party)
3. Check bitcoin address balance using an in-built blockchain explorer
4. Receive bitcoin
5. Send bitcoin
6. Allow transaction parties (sender and receiver) to communicate with each other using Bitcoin's in-built messaging system



**What outputs can we expect from it?**

The project will produce an app for Linux and Windows desktops. This app is non-custodial, giving users full control of their funds. The app does not generate any earnings.
